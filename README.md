A woman who regularly goes on spontaneous late-night runs, walks the two and a half miles home from work in the dark almost daily, and has headed out
on first dates with virtual strangers on more than a few occasions needs a tool, a direction

Now women needs to step up their safety game!

Safeweg is an app coded for safest route embedded with accident detection. Crimes are surging day by day,women being swayed and raped,molestations happening 
and all kind of viscious things . That's where Safe comes into play. This application has a blend of unique features like the safest route to help commute safely, even the
celebrities, travellers, money loading vehicles, and many more. It plummets the risk of unsafe travelling to a greater extent. For instance, most rape cases in India 
are committed on road. The USA has high gunshots deaths. These localities can be avoided while travelling using SafeWeg by navigating them through the safest route. 
There are many accident detection hardware available on this planet, but none like our software-based systems. This makes it cheap for the common man who drives 
a low-priced vehicle that is not embedded with this much-needed feature. You need not own a Telsa for that! SafeWeg comes into play. Followed by gyroscopic analysis and 
location tracking, the desired results are achievable. People are reluctant to buy expensive hardware for such use cases.

Imagine, you have been stuck on a highway at night with your car broken down and none provides aid. To spice it up, your network is also down. Don't worry SafeWeg saves
the data of nearest garages (like offline maps, phone numbers) by using garage caching. Thus will be of great help while facing such situations.

The most accoladed feature of the app is to establish a connection between SafeWeg users in each other's vicinity. This can be done with graphing. 
The main use of this feature is to send an accident SOS to your family, or friends if your phone is destroyed. Moreover, this can be used to monitor driving 
patterns in a particular region.Hence women can now have their guide or the saviour for a situation in their own hands, Quickest yet covers and provides an 
on time aid. 

That sums up SafeWeg!
